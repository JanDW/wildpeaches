There are people who go by the moniker of mathematician. 

They are known to like to try and impress everyone by making up symbols like $\varphi$. Sometimes they'll write stuff like ${3x-1}+(1+x)^2$ and feel quite chuffed with themselves. A group of mathematicians is known as a *misery* of mathematicians. In a misery, they have been observed to start peacocking and consequently regurgitate such monstrosities as:

$$\begin{array}{c}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &
= \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0
\end{array}$$

Yeah, right. Like that drivel means anything. Homeopathy can cure cancer and Alex Jones will be remembered as a philosopher of Plato's significance. Sure.

I kid, I kid. I have great respect for mathematicians. I'll take them over serial killers any day. 

I'm not sure it was such a great idea to not use *lorem ipsum* for this demonstration post. As it turns out, I'll use it as an opportunity to offend more educated people than myself. This proves that immigrants can become Americans quite fast.

Alright, that's enough paragraphs for me, time to move on to some other elements.

Here's a [link](https://jandewilde.org), I always forgot how to create them in markdown until I used the mnemonic device: b before p, brackets before parens.

Code can be useful, can't it? It might be widely used one day. However its use should not be overstated since:

1. you can't eat it
1. it does not eliminate body odor. 
1. lists look better with at least three items

These are some clear shortcomings. Nevertheless, a sprinkling of it is forthcoming. After all the unwarranted rudeness, let me extend an olive branch and use MATLAB to show syntax highlighting.

```matlab
ds = tabularTextDatastore('airlinesmall.csv');
ds.TreatAsMissing = 'NA';
ds.SelectedVariableNames = {'Year','Month','ArrDelay','DepDelay','Origin','Dest'};
ds.SelectedFormats(5:6) = {'%C','%C'};
pre = preview(ds)
```

By Erdős—your number, John?—such gobbledygook! No wonder most mathematicians die alone.
